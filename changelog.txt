- Arbitrary order parameters can be introduced in the 
  option orderparameters.txt. Two options are possible:
  
  dist x -1 -0.1 0.1 1 
  
  This defines a distance between two indcies as order parameter
  dist1 and dist2 are given in runoptions. The second parameter
  defines the direction (can be x,y,z, or abs). The next parameters
  define the stable states A and B in the following order minA,maxA,
  minB,maxB.
  
  custom customPlugin
  
  This defines a custom order parameter. The second parameter is the
  name of the python file in the custom directory. This particular 
  example would require that the file ./custom/customPlugin.py exists.
  customPlugin has to define a class named TCustomOrderParameter(object)
  which provides the functions isPathInState and getFullTrajectory.
  
  class TCustomOrderParameter(object):
    def __init__(self):
      self.A = [-4.0,-0.6]
      self.B = [0.6,4.0]
  	   
  	def isPathInState(self,path,log):
      ...
      
      return finishedState,isInState
  	
  	
  	def getFullTrajectory(self,fpath,bpath,fdir,bdir,log):
  	  ...
  	  
  	  return traj

- gromacspostfix: This option can be set to eg. "_f" in order to allow for mdrun_f instead of mdrun

- dynamicshooting: added option "dynamicshooting" in kerneloptions.txt in order to allow for mpi jobs
over multiple nodes Jeroen is going to implement

10.Dec 2010 wolf

- option "shootfrominterface" added. If this is 1 then the trajectories are shot from the interface
and not from a random point along the trajectory.

- reversepaths are started now in the shooting queue as soon as the todolist is finished but some jobs
are still running.
